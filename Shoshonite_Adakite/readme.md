## Exploratory geochemical analysis of shoshonites and adakites from the EarthChem database

### About
* This project consists of an exploratory analysis of a public geochemistry database using python, pandas, openpyxl, and matplotlib.
* The main goal is to identify two classes of rocks: Shoshonites and Adakites within the database and plot them in classic geochemistry diagrams.
